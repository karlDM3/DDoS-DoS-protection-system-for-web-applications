# DDoS-DoS-protection-system-for-web-applications
### Description:
This Python-based solution provides an essential set of security mechanisms aimed at protecting web applications from **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)** and **Denial of Service (DoS)** attacks. The system utilizes Flask to create a server that includes multiple layers of defense to handle suspicious traffic and mitigate the risk of service disruption caused by these attacks.

#### Key Features:
1. **Rate Limiting**: 
   - Limits the number of requests that can be made by a single IP address within a specified time window (e.g., 60 requests per minute). This helps to prevent excessive requests from any single source and protects against DoS attacks.

2. **IP Blacklisting**: 
   - Suspicious IP addresses that exceed defined thresholds (e.g., too many requests or failed CAPTCHA verifications) are added to a blacklist and denied further access to the application.

3. **CAPTCHA Verification**: 
   - To prevent automated bot traffic, the system challenges suspected bots with CAPTCHA-like challenges. Only after a correct response is received, the traffic from that IP is allowed to continue. This helps to protect against DDoS attacks by ensuring that only legitimate users can proceed.

4. **Traffic Analysis & DDoS Detection**: 
   - The system continuously monitors traffic patterns for anomalies, such as an unusually high number of requests from a single IP within a short period. If potential DDoS behavior is detected, the offending IP is immediately blacklisted.

5. **Logging & Monitoring**:
   - Suspicious activities are logged for future analysis. The system logs events like rate limit violations, failed CAPTCHA responses, and IP blacklisting. These logs can help security teams monitor for potential attacks and respond quickly.

6. **Background Traffic Monitoring**:
   - A dedicated thread runs in the background, constantly monitoring traffic in real-time. It detects potential DDoS attacks and updates blacklists dynamically to protect the server from malicious traffic.

#### Benefits:
- **Proactive Protection**: Protects your web application against common and severe DoS/DDoS attacks without needing external services.
- **Scalability**: Designed to be easily configurable to handle different attack patterns and traffic loads.
- **Security Layering**: Implements multiple layers of defense, from rate limiting to CAPTCHA challenges, to ensure a robust defense against a variety of attack strategies.
- **Real-time Response**: Offers immediate detection and mitigation, preventing the web server from being overwhelmed by malicious traffic.
